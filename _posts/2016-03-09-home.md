description: "Spreyton Cider Co's traditional ciders are made using the time honoured cider making techniques of England and France, and as you might expect at 7.5 - 8% ABV they pack a punch in more ways than one! These flavour packed ciders are fermented in the bottle to produce lightly carbonated ciders reminiscent in appearance to fine champagne."
